# Fuzz targets

This directory holds `cargo-fuzz` (libFuzzer) targets, one per parser of
network input: DNS messages, DHCPv4/DHCPv6 packets and options, zone files,
import formats and similar.

Project rule: every parser of network input ships with a fuzz target here
before it merges.

There are no targets yet.

## Running

Fuzzing requires a nightly toolchain and `cargo-fuzz`:

```sh
cargo install cargo-fuzz
cargo +nightly fuzz list
cargo +nightly fuzz run <target>
```

## Layout

- The fuzz crate is its own workspace and is excluded from the main workspace.
- `fuzz/artifacts/`, `fuzz/corpus/` and `fuzz/coverage/` are git-ignored.
- Small, meaningful seed corpora may be committed under `fuzz/seeds/<target>/`.
  Pass the directory as an extra corpus argument:
  `cargo +nightly fuzz run <target> fuzz/corpus/<target> fuzz/seeds/<target>`.
